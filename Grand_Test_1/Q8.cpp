/*
    Write a function that takes three values x,y,z as parameters and returns
    x ^ y, y ^ z, z ^ x. Take x, y and z as input from the user and print the
    values returned by the function.
    Hint: The function takes two parameters and returns one value. So, you have
    to call the function thrice. You can also use pow() function.
